<h1>Zepto Interview Question</h1>

<h2>Question Requirements</h2>

<p>
    1. When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
    <br>
    2. As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
    <br>
    3. Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
    <br>
    4. Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
    <br>
    5. Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
